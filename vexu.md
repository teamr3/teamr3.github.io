VexU acts as a R3â€™s introductory team. The challenges presented within the Vex competition are much simpler compared to those associated with the Rover or Sub. We take advantage of having a platform like Vex to teach students important engineering skills like electrical and mechanical CAD software, industry tools and best practices for programming, and high level design and control concepts. These are the skills required to tackle other engineering challenges.
