R3 has been developing and testing mars rovers for the University Rover Challenge for the past three years. The original aim of the rover team was to develop a rover capable of placing in the top 5, since our originally entry R3 has placed; 21st in our first year (2017), 15th in our second year (2018) and 2nd  in the 2019 competition. The current goal for the rover team is to continue to develop high scoring rovers in the hopes of winning the competition, and being a regular podium contender.

This allows it to easily traverse almost any terrain and pick and place incredibly quickly. Additionally, with its high power drivetrain, Navi is by far the fastest rover at URC. The simplicity and elegance of the arm design allows direct control with no need for inverse kinematics as well as the ability to swap end effectors depending on the task.

What makes Navi's control system different from previous years is the increased focus on design simplicity. Naviâ€™s on communications protocols have been changed to utilize more open source software, allowing our students to focus more on testing and low level design. The rover also implements a unique autonomous system, Navi utilizes a YOLO V3 algorithm for image detection and avoidance, paired with a GPS and IMU for global path planning. 

Implementing and developing this rover concept and design over the past three years, paired with the amazing students we have working on this project have allowed us the ability to place 2nd  in the 2019 competition and will continue to develop high level rovers.
